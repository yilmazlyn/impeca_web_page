# impeca_web_page

This is a simple single web page that I realised for a friend who uses it as a showcase of his activities in UK.

Stack :
HTML - CSS - JS
Tailwind CSS libraries
PHP (Contact Form Handle)
Gen_Validator for form validation (Thanks to javascript-coder.com)

If you'd to like, you can install the assets folder of Tailwind starter kit in order to use Tailwind CSS and display the web page correctly.
